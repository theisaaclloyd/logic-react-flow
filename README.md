This project is the result of a couple months of work and a lot of learning. I built this logic simulator project to deepen my skills using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I also wanted to learn more about the ReactFlow library, which I used heavily throughout the project in order to build the user interface.

The whole point of this project was to create a simple yet powerful tool for not only learning about logic gates and digital circuits and how they work, but also to provide a robust platform for creating and testing digital circuits.

This project is still a work in progress, and I plan to continue adding more amazing features and improvements. Please feel free to reach out to me with any feedback or suggestions you may have. I would love to hear from you!
